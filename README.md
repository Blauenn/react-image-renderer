# A Simple image render
(IDK what to call it tbh)

## Give an image, it gets the EXIF, display them, and you can download them

I make cosplay photography content. I take a lot of pictures, and I want to show them to my viewers.
Yes, I can just put the image in the video directly. But I feel like it'd be better if I show the settings and some other information.
Doing them in Photoshop is a tedious task, so I decided to waste those time making this.
It's a new layout, it will be used soon
